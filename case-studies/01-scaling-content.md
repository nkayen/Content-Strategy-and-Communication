<br>
I started as a Technical Writer with the objective to create and maintain a centralized knowledge base for processes, platforms, tools, and clarity on the organization's strategy. 
As our audience grew by the thousands in just a few years, my responsibilities grew to include Release Management and Governance, as well as Learning and Development strategy and development. <br><br>
I owned the chain from process to training to implementation and maintenance and drove organizational efficiency and clarity by creating and maintaining standardized knowledge, training, and communication systems.

## STRATEGIC PROFILE <br>
### **Knowledge Management** <br> 
Developed and maintained a centralized knowledge repository in Confluence, documenting and maintaining the core processes and standards that adapted through multiple major reorganizations for the entire Managed Services division (which grew from 300 to 17.000 in 5 years) and cross-functional business areas (upto 30.000 employees worldwide). <br><br>

### **Standardization & Compliance** <br> 
Led the development and implementation of standardized processes, platforms and tools that aligned complex operational content with key industry standards (ITIL, ISO, CIS, SOC) for Operations and Delivery.<br><br
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
### **Process Ownership** <br>
Owned the chain from process creation to implementation and maintenance, and drove organizational efficiency and clarity to ensure all knowledge and communication systems were standardized and accessible to a global user base.<br><br>

### **Stakeholder Coordination** <br> 
Orchestrated strategic content initiatives through effective stakeholder engagement with cross-functional teams to directly support digital transformation efforts. This included close alignment to the PMO (Project Management Office) in charge of executing the organizational changes and strategies. <br>

## CHALLENGES AND RESTRAINTS <br>
### **Managing Change and Rapid Growth** <br>
Rapid growth through multiple (and overlapping) mergers and acquisitions created significant strategic and organizational challenges, process inconsistencies, and inefficient employee onboarding. <br>
* The **challenge** was to centralize, standardize, and scale all training and knowledge systems in line with the PMO (Project Management Office) in charge of organization strategy execution, and pivot where and when required. <br>
* The **outcome** successfully aligned releases and deployments of new processes, standards, and technology to organization wide initiatives through Agile iterations and structured feedback sessions, regardless of whether these projects were done as Agile, Waterfall, Swivelchair, etc. <br><br>

### **Harmonizing a Fragmented Workforce** <br>
Centralizing de-centralized and fragmented ways of working by adapting global processes and standards, and curating and maintaining a centralized knowledge repository in line with industry standards. <br>
* The **challenge** was to ensure the process not only accurately reflected the correct industry standard process workflow, the corresponding ServiceNow process workflow, and met compliance and governance requirements, but was also agreed to by all stakeholders and reflected the most optimal way of working regardless of which party had the political overhand in the related merger/acquisition. <br>
* The **outcome** scaled the business away from silos and into a globally homogenous way of working through adaption by outcome and efficiency, rather than habits and individual practices, directly increasing client satisfaction and ease of reporting and governance through intensive workshops, analysis and iterative release management. <br><br>

### **Designing Agile Frameworks** <br>
Developing learning and communication-frameworks that could grow with the organization and would not need to be redrafted with every change of direction. <br>
* The **challenge** was to align with the organization's key communication standards and define content and communication frameworks to ensure they could remain a constant and recognizable source of information through successive organizational and strategic changes. <br>
* The **outcome** saw content and communication frameworks aligned to organizational core strategies by priority, scale, scope, and impact, rather than by locale, team, or demographic. <br><br>

### **Creating Universal Content** <br>
Creating documentation and training for new and existing employees regardless of individual background, learning style, English language level, educational background, or professional experience. <br>
* The **challenge** was to provide training in clear and simple language without losing its professional tone with the right mix of text, visuals, and interactive elements, to not only keep all learners engaged, but also actively absorbing the content. <br>
* The **outcome** facilitated ease of on-boarding and absorption, structured knowledge progression and clear, role-based learning frameworks. Further mitigating loss of information transfer between the process documentation and learning content by owning the chain of work from inception to implementation.
